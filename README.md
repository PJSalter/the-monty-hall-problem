# the-monty-hall-problem :door:

###### creating an intepretation of The Monty Hall problem which was tasked by Zaizi, this is a probability puzzle that catches many people out when first encountered. Vos Savant presented a solution that was, initially, rejected in the popular media of the day.

###### Writing a program that demonstrates that Vos Savant is correct. You will use the output of your program to convince your interviewer that, after the host opens a door, switching doors is always the correct choice.

# User Story:

- ###### There will be three closed doors and the user will be given a choice to choose one of them. there is a car behind one of the doors, the other doors contain goats. it will function as the computer knows about the placement of the car and goats.
- ###### After the user chooses a door, the game itself will open one of the other two doors that will carry a goat.
- ###### The user may wish to stick with there original choice or switch the door.

# I need to complete these requirements:

- [x] Gain an understanding of the problem - perhaps see how your friends react if you play the part of the host.
- [x] Convince yourself that Vos Savant was correct.
- [x] Design and write software that will run sample games employing either the stick or switch strategy.
- [x] Put the code in a public GitHub repository
- [x] Use your software to show that switching doors is statistically the best option.
- [x] The elegance of the output is not important so long as the program can be used to prove the point.
